# Wisteria Roadmap

Welcome to Wisteria!

To run the app on the frontend, include the 
following HTML snippet anywhere on the page: 

```html
<div id="wisteria-roadmap">
	The roadmap is loading...
</div>
```

After adding the HTML somewhere in your app, here are some basics to get you started: 

- To add an item, double-click in the location you'd like to add to and complete the form that pops up.
- Right click on an item to delete it. Be sure to confirm when the confirmation box appears.
- Scrolling with your cursor within the roadmap bouandries will zoom in or out.
